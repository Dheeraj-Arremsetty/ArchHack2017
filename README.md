We believe that a good nights sleep keeps you fresh, relax and energized for the day. Improves memory, reduces risks of diseases.

### HOW?
Using the smart pillow will help us collect data on your sleep pattern and deliver analysis based on this data. Also, this data can help us serve you better with sensors and better response.
